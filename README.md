### Minimize Security Threat Risk

A non-completed list of actions you should take to minimize the security threat risk in your organization, follows. 

Does it sound familiar? If not, then your IT is might lying to you..


* Audit your systems: Conduct a thorough audit of your systems to ensure that they are secure and functioning properly. This could involve reviewing access logs, monitoring network traffic, and checking for any vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Auditing your systems can help you identify vulnerabilities and ensure that your IT infrastructure is secure and functioning properly. Here are some steps you can take to audit your systems:

* Identify the assets: Create a list of all the devices, applications, and systems that are used in your IT infrastructure. This includes servers, workstations, laptops, mobile devices, and any other hardware or software used in your organization.

* Review access controls: Review your access controls to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive data and systems. This includes reviewing user accounts, permissions, and password policies.

* Monitor network traffic: Monitor your network traffic to identify any unusual or suspicious activity. This could involve setting up intrusion detection systems (IDS) or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to identify and prevent attacks.

* Perform vulnerability scanning: Use automated tools to perform vulnerability scanning to identify potential security weaknesses in your systems. These tools can identify vulnerabilities such as unpatched software, open ports, or weak passwords.

* Conduct penetration testing: Perform penetration testing to simulate attacks and identify weaknesses in your systems. This can involve attempting to exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive data or systems.

* Review logs: Review system logs to identify any unusual or suspicious activity. This includes reviewing login attempts, system events, and other system logs to identify any potential security incidents.

* Review running and exposed services to the internet: Review exposed services to the internet to identify any unusual or suspicious activity.

* Implement remediation measures: Once you have identified vulnerabilities or weaknesses in your systems, implement remediation measures to address the issues. This could involve patching software, updating access controls, or implementing additional security measures.

* By following these steps, you can audit your systems and identify potential security weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. Regular auditing and monitoring of your systems can help you ensure that your IT infrastructure is secure and functioning properly.

* Keep your software up to date: Make sure that all software and operating systems are up to date with the latest security patches and updates. This can help prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited by attackers.

* Use strong passwords: Implement strong password policies, including complex passwords and regular password changes. This can help prevent unauthorized access to your systems and data.

* Use multi-factor authentication: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data and systems. MFA requires users to provide two or more forms of authentication, such as a password and a biometric scan, which makes it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access.

* Train employees on security best practices: Educate your employees on security best practices, including how to identify and report potential security incidents, how to create strong passwords, and how to avoid phishing attacks.

* Regularly test and update your disaster recovery plan: Have a disaster recovery plan in place that outlines how your organization will respond in the event of a security incident or disaster. Regularly test and update your plan to ensure that it is effective and up to date.

* Conduct regular backups: Conduct regular backups of all your data to ensure that you can recover quickly in the event of a disaster or security incident. It is important to ensure that backups are stored securely and can be accessed easily in case of an emergency.

* Encrypt sensitive data: Encrypt sensitive data that is stored or transmitted across your systems. This can help prevent unauthorized access to data even if a breach occurs.

* Harden your systems: Reduce vulnerabilities and attack surface by hardening your services using best practises.

* Monitor third-party vendors: If your organization uses third-party vendors, make sure to monitor their security practices and ensure that they meet your organization's security standards. This includes reviewing their contracts and service level agreements to ensure that they meet your security requirements.

* Conduct regular security training: Conduct regular security training for all employees to keep them up to date on the latest threats and security best practices. This includes phishing awareness training to help employees recognize and avoid phishing attacks.

* Perform regular tests: Perform regular tests on your systems to ensure that they are secure and functioning properly. This includes testing for vulnerabilities, performing penetration testing, and conducting tabletop exercises to simulate security incidents.
